  # Particle Omission {#ommision}

  When combined with :grammar[noun_은_는]{noprefix topic} or
  :grammar[noun_을_를]{noprefix object} the :grammar[noun_도]
  particle can replace them entirely, rather than appending to them.

  In other cases, it functions as usual, adding its meaning without replacing
  any existing particles
