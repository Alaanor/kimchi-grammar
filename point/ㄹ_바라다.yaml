  # Usage with verbs {#usage-with-verbs}

  The structure starts with a :grammar[noun_을_를]{object} which can sometimes be
  omitted if implied. This is why you may see the phrase <f>"-기(를) 바라다"</f> in
  grammar books. Since :grammar[ㄹ_바라다]{hope} requires a noun as its object,
  verbs must first be nominalized using :grammar[verb_기]{verb-to-noun}.

  # Pronunciation {#pronunciation}

  Often pronounced as 바래요 instead of 바라요. While the latter is the correct
  form you might see 바래요 used more often in speech and written Korean.
