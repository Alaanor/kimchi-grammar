  # Usage {#usage}
  
  ## With politeness
  
  The grammar pattern :grammar[verb_요] is extremely common.
  It is used with a lot of other grammar patterns to make the sentence polite.
  
  ## With short reply
  
  The same can be done in English. Eg. "What is your name?".

  - Long answer "My name is John."
  - Short answer "John".

  Since it would be rude in Korean to just say "John". You can add this :grammar[noun_요]. Not to be confused with :grammar[noun_이다] + :grammar[verb_요].
