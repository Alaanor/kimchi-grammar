  # Usage {#usage}

  # :grammar[noun_로_으로]{direction} VS :grammar[noun_에]{direction}
  
  The :grammar[noun_로_으로]{noprefix} particle highlights direction, allowing for the use of terms that indicate
  directions such as "left, right". This contrasts with the :grammar[noun_에]{noprefix} particle, which focuses
  on the destination element within the sentence. Since "left, right" indicate direction rather than specific
  destinations, they cannot be used with the :grammar[noun_에]{noprefix} particle.
