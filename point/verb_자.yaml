  # Suggestion {#suggestion}

  :grammar[verb_자]{suggestion} is used to make informal suggestions to do something together. The more formal version of this expression is :grammar[verb_읍시다_ㅂ시다]{suggestion}.

  # Simultaneous Action {#simultaneous-action}

  :grammar[verb_자]{simultaneous-action} indicates that the second action happens **as** or **when** the first action is occurring. Unlike :grammar[verb_자마자]{as-soon-as}, which emphasizes that the second action happens **immediately after** the first, **V-자** in this usage conveys that the two actions are closely connected in time, often overlapping.

  **Note:** This usage of :grammar[verb_자] is more common in written or formal contexts and is less frequently used in spoken Korean. In conversational Korean, :grammar[verb_으니까_니까]{reason-or-cause} or :grammar[verb_아서_어서_해서]{reason-or-cause} might be used instead.
