  # 는 거
  
  In spoken or casual language, 는 것 is often shortened to 는 거. Spoken language transcribed to text may often be written this way.
  
  ::example[친구를 만나는 거 항상 즐거워. | The act of meeting friends is always enjoyable.]
  
  # 는거

  Native speakers often colloquially write 는거 (without the space). It doesn't strictly follow spacing rules, so its a common "mistake". The meaning is the same.

  ::example[알고 있는거지? | You know that, right?]
  ::example[그가 도움을 요청하는거지, 그래서 우리가 도와줘야 해. | It's that he is asking for help, so we need to help.]
