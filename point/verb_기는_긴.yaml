  긴 can also be used in reduplicative expressions such as -긴 -구나 (좋긴 좋구나) or -긴 -ㄴ가/나 보다 (힘들긴 힘든가 보다). The former adds emphasis to a -구나 expression, and the latter adds emphasis to a -ㄴ가/나 보다 expression, with the added nuance that the speaker has experienced or noticed several things that have confirmed their impression of a situation being a certain way.
