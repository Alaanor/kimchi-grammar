  # Particle Omission {#ommision}

  The object marker :grammar[noun_을_를] is used to indicate that a noun is the
  object in a sentence. In formal Korean, its use is more strict to clearly
  define the sentence structure. However, in colloquial speech, this particle is
  often omitted for brevity or when the context already makes the object clear.

  # Contraction {#contraction}

  Certain cases allow for contraction, such as <f>저</f> and <span
  c-orange>를</f> merging to form <f>절</f>.
